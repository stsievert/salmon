Experiment monitoring
=====================

While participants are answering queries, you can track the state of the
experiment by visiting ``http://[url]:8421/dashboard``. Initially, this will be
fairly barren because users haven't responded.

After users respond, the dashboard will show the following information:

* **Basic information** (start time, number of participants, etc)
* **User response times** (e.g., when did the users respond?)
* **Server side timing** (e.g., how long did it take to process each API
  endpoint?)
* **Client side timing** (e.g., how long did they spend waiting or thinking
  about their response?)
* **Algorithm timing** (e.g., how long do model updates take?)
* An **embedding** for each algorithm.
* The list of targets.

Bolded links are particularly useful. I download all bolded links before
stopping or restarting the machine running Salmon (except the query page).
