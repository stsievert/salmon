# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#

import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("../"))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = "Salmon"
copyright = "2019, Scott Sievert"
author = "Scott Sievert"

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
from salmon import __version__

    "github_user": "stsievert",  # Username
    "github_repo": "salmon",  # Repo name
    "github_version": "master",  # Version
    "conf_py_path": "/source/",  # Path in the checkout to the docs root
}

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    "sphinx.ext.autosummary",
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
    "numpydoc",

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = ["_build", "Thumbs.db", ".DS_Store"]


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path = ["_static"]
autodoc_mock_imports = ["fastapi", "rejson", "pydantic", "starlette"]

# Lifted from https://github.com/dask/dask-jobqueue/pull/301/files
#
# Temporary work-around for spacing problem between parameter and parameter
# type in the doc, see https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc/issues/215. The bug
# has been fixed in sphinx (https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/5976) but
# through a change in sphinx basic.css except rtd_theme does not use basic.css.
# In an ideal world, this would get fixed in this PR:
# https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/pull/747/files
def setup(app):
    app.add_stylesheet("basic.css")
