One image filename is `01F_HA_C`. I presume `01F` is an ID number for a
particular female actor, `HA` means the actor is showing a "happy" emotion
and `C` means her mouth is closed.

* Possible emotions: `DI, FE, HA, NE, SA, SP, AN, CA`
* Possible mouths: `C` (closed), `O` (open), `X` (? only happens for `HA`
  emotion)
