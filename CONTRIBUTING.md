## Contributing/making changes to Salmon

Changes to Salmon are greatly appreciated. If you'd like to submit a change,
please follow this workflow:

1. Fork on Salmon on GitHub ([docs][fork-docs], [Salmon source]).
2. Make changes on a new branch.
3. Submit a pull request ([docs][pr-docs]).

This generally follows [GitHub Flow][git-flow].

In practice, I make changes to my fork/branch and push my changes:

``` shell
$ # fork Salmon on GitHub
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/salmon.git
$ git checkout -b new-feature
$ # make changes
$ git push --set-upstream origin new-feature
```

Then, I click on the big green button GitHub provides:
