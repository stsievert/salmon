## Contributing/making changes to Salmon

Changes to Salmon are greatly appreciated. If you'd like to submit a change,
please follow this workflow:

1. Fork on Salmon on GitHub ([docs][fork-docs], [Salmon source]).
2. Make changes.
3. Submit a pull request ([docs][pr-docs]).

In practice, I make changes to my fork/branch and push my changes:

``` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/salmon.git
$ # make changes
$ git checkout -b new-feature
$ # make changes
$ git push --set-upstream origin paper
```

Then, I click on the big green button GitHub provides:

![Pull request button]("docs/source/imgs/pull-request.png")
